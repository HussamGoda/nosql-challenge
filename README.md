# nosql-challenge

The repo "npsql-challenge" contains files meant to address requirements defined in week 12 challenge concerining Nosql databases.


The repo contains a folder "Starter_Code", inside which a folder named "Resources" and two sets of jupyter notebook files (four files in total) are placed. The four jupyter notebooks contian answers to the challenge requiremnets.


The folder "Resources" contains a JSON file to be used to create the database uk_food with the collection "establishments".


The origional jupyter notebook starter files did not ask to change RatingValue to integer. However, in the challange steps explained in the BootCamp webiste, there is a requirement to change RatingValue to integer. With that in Mind, I decided to create two sets of jupyter notebook files (henece the reason of having four of them).

- NoSQL_setup_starter and NoSQL_analysis_starter address challenge questions without changing RatingValue to Integer.


- NoSQL_setup_starter_1 and NoSQL_analysis_starter_1 address challenge questions with changing RatingValue to Integer.


Please feel free to check the set you prefer.
